# Emotion-Detection-using-CNNs
This project involves the building and execution of a baseline Convolutional Neural Network and three popular CNN architectures: LeNet5, AlexNet, VGG16. 
Future improvements to the code would include tuning learning rate for optimizers and comparison of performance across activation functions.
Moreover, the current prevalent architectures used are better suited for several hundreds of classes and are therefore difficult to use in their current form on smaller datasets. The modification of the architectures to smaller datasets is another point for improvement.
